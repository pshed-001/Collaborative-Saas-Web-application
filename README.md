## Database Schema

**User** — stores credentials and profile info  
**Workspace** — team spaces with PUBLIC or PRIVATE visibility  
**Membership** — links users to workspaces with roles (ADMIN, MEMBER) and statuses (ACTIVE, PENDING, REJECTED, REMOVED, LEFT)  
**Task** — created within a workspace, can be assigned and completed by members

## API Reference

### Auth — `/auth`

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | Register a new user |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Login and receive tokens |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | Rotate access token using refresh token |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Clear session |

### Workspaces — `/workspace`

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/workspace` | ✅ | Create a workspace |
| GET | `/workspace` | ✅ | Get all public workspaces |
| GET | `/workspace/me` | ✅ | Get workspaces you belong to |
| GET | `/workspace/:id` | ✅ | Get workspace content |
| POST | `/workspace/:id/join` | ✅ | Request to join |
| GET | `/workspace/:id/members` | ✅ | List members |
| PATCH | `/workspace/:id/members/:userId/approve` | ✅ Admin | Approve join request |
| PATCH | `/workspace/:id/members/:userId/reject` | ✅ Admin | Reject join request |
| PATCH | `/workspace/:id/members/:userId/remove` | ✅ Admin | Remove a member |
| PATCH | `/workspace/:id/update` | ✅ Admin | Update workspace details |
| DELETE | `/workspace/:id/delete` | ✅ Owner | Soft delete (moves to trash) |
| PATCH | `/workspace/:id/recover` | ✅ Owner | Recover from trash (within 30 days) |
| PATCH | `/workspace/:id/leave` | ✅ | Leave a workspace |

### Auth Flow

1. `POST /auth/login` returns an access token in the `Authorization` header and a refresh token as an `httpOnly` cookie
2. Include `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` on protected requests
3. When the access token expires, call `POST /auth/refresh` — both tokens are rotated

## Known Issues

- `task` and `membership` modules are not yet implemented
- No CORS configuration — frontend requests will be blocked until added
- No rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Frontend is not yet built

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement task module (create, assign, complete)
- [ ] Implement membership module
- [ ] Add CORS middleware
- [ ] Add rate limiting on auth routes
- [ ] Build React frontend
- [ ] Add pagination to workspace list endpoints
- [ ] Write tests
